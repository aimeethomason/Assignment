# Agent-Based Model

This repository provides access to an agent-based model, using the fundamental model, agent and environment codes. Through excellent documentation, useful comments and broader coding concepts, the model:

  - builds agents in a space;
  - gets them to interact with each other;
  - reads in environmental data;
  - gets agents to interact with the environment;
  - randomise the order of agent actions;
  - displays the model as an animation;
  - is contained within a GUI;
  - is initialised with data from the web.
