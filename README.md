# Assignment 1: Agent-Based Model
 
This repository provides access to **Assignment One.**

The overall aim of the assignment was to construct an **agent-based model (ABM)** that would produce an animation of sheep moving around a set environment, modelling their eating behaviour and how the sheep share their food stores.

Through excellent documentation, constructive comments and broader coding concepts, the model should:

  - builds agents in a space;
  - gets them to interact with each other;
  - reads in environmental data;
  - gets agents to interact with the environment;
  - randomise the order of agent actions;
  - displays the model as an animation;
  - is contained within a GUI;
  - is initialised with data from the web.
