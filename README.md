# Agent-Based Model

This repository provides access to an agent-based model, using the fundamental model, agent and environment codes. Through excellent documentation and useful comments, the model gets code to interact with other code as well as it's users. This is achieved through the following broader coding concepts:

  - Variables and Lists;
  - Control Flow Ftatements;
  - Functions;
  - Classes and Objects;
  - I/O;
  - Agent Communication
  - Matplotlib (Animation and Behaviour)
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI) / Web Scraping
