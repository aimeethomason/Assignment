Msc Geographical Information Systems - University of Leeds 

In a society where human activity is increasingly associated with growing volumes of data, it is clear to me that Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a field I want to further discover. Having studied BA Geography at the University of Liverpool for three years, I was able to learn the basic functions and theoretical knowledge in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Postgraduate level then introduced GIS with particular reference to the socioeconomic and environmental sciences, enabling me to confidently underpin skills within spatial data models, data capture, spatial analysis and statistical and mathematical modelling.

My online portfolio provides an opportunity to share some of my programming practical work using both spyder and github.
