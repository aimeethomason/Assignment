**A 21-year-old 'forever student', currently studying MSc Geographical Information Systems (GIS) at the University of Leeds.**

GIS only became apparent to me after studying BA Geography at the University of Liverpool. During my three years at Liverpool,  I was able to learn the basic functions and theoretical knowledge in GIS. At this point, I realised the importance of GIS and how human activity is increasingly associated with growing volumes of data.

This motivated me to study MSc Geographical Information Systems (GIS) at the University of Leeds with the aim of becoming a GIS analyst.  Postgraduate level introduced GIS to me with particular reference to the socio-economic and environmental sciences. I am now able to confidently underpin skills within spatial data models, data capture, spatial analysis and statistical and mathematical modelling, using a range of applications including ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, R, Minitab, SPSS, Python and Github.

This online portfolio provides an opportunity for me to share the skills gained in **GEOG5590: Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills.**
