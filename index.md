**About me:**

Hello! I am Aimee Thomason, a 21 year-old postgraduate student from Leeds.

Having studied BA Geography at the University of Liverpool for three years, I was able to learn the basic functions and theoretical knowledge in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Here, I was introduced to ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, R, Minitab and SPSSS. Postgraduate level allowed me to further these skills by introducing GIS with particular reference to the socioeconomic and environmental sciences. This enabled me to confidently underpin skills within spatial data models, data capture, spatial analysis and statistical and mathematical modelling. 

This online portfolio provides an opportunity to share the skills gained in GEOG5590: Programming, particularily using Python and Github.
